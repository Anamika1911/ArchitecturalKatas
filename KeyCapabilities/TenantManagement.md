# Overview
Tenant management sits at the top of system. Every customer will be treated as different tenant. So, this system is treated as multi-tenant system. 

## Geographically Distributed Deployment
Since, customers may reside in different geographies, or one customer may have farms in multiple regions, we will support deployment in regions closer to farm. Solution can be deployed on any cloud platform. 
When tenant is onboarded, he will be required to furnish information about the location where farms exist and accordingly services will be deployed in the specified region.
